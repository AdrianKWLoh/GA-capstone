## Singapore Private Residential Property Rental Market Investigation and Prediction
Sales transaction dominates the property scene in Singapore, while the rental market does not attract as much media attention. I attempt to address this information gap by identifying factors that drive the rent for private residential property market in Singapore.

A good understanding and robust prediction will help house owners to place their asking rent suitably, while potential tenants can benefit by short listing units that suit their budget.<p>
